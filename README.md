# PHP Development Essentials, a Visual Studio Code extension package.

## Background

Are you tired of reinstalling extensions on each of your computer(s)? How about when you have to reset computer entirely? Or, how about you're an instructor, a hobbyist, or just "getting your feet wet" in the fine craft of web development who does not know which extension(s) to select to get the job done both efficiently and effectively. Regardless, please do not waste time and energy on something so tedious as a process of installing extensions. Extensions are, in a word, awesome! Their premise is to extend the features and functionality of Visual Studio Code.

### More information will come soon on how to get the most out of this extension pack.


## Note

It is my pledge to update this Extension Package with update extension as needed to perform the job efficiently and effectively. Likewise, the Extensions list will be categorized accordingly in the near future. Cheers! :)

**Please enjoy! Cheers!**
